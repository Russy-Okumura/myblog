                <h2></h2>
                <p>
                    Today we are going to talk about a difficult day
                    I woke up feeling confident. Today was the day I had to defend my philosophical stance 
                    in front of my class, a crucial part of my final grade. I had prepared for weeks, 
                    refining my arguments and anticipating counterpoints. Everything was set… or so I thought.<br><br>
                    
                    As soon as I got on the bus, exhaustion hit me. I had barely slept the night before, going 
                    over my notes again and again. The soft humming of the engine and the rhythmic movement of 
                    the bus were too much for my tired body. Before I knew it, I had fallen asleep.<br><br>
                    
                    When I woke up, I panicked. The bus had already passed my stop, and I had no idea where I was. 
                    My heart pounded as I rushed to the front, asking the driver where we were. He barely glanced 
                    at me before telling me I was far from my destination. I had no choice but to wait for the next 
                    stop and find my way back.<br><br>

                    But that wasn’t the worst part. While I sat there, trying to calm myself, an older man sitting 
                    nearby started staring at me. At first, I ignored it, thinking it was nothing. But then, he 
                    began making uncomfortable comments, smirking as he leaned closer. His tone was unsettling, 
                    his presence invasive. My body tensed up, and then it happened, he placed his hand on my leg.<br><br>
                    
                    A wave of anger and disgust rushed through me. I froze for a second, my mind racing between 
                    confronting him and avoiding making a scene, at that moment I didn't want it to be known. I 
                    quickly shifted in my seat, moving his hand away, and shot him a glare. My heart was pounding, 
                    but I refused to let fear take over. <br><br>
                    
                    As soon as the bus stopped, I jumped out, feeling both relief and frustration. I was already 
                    late, and now I had to sprint to school, I didn't have time to think about what had happened. 
                    When I finally arrived, my professor gave me a cold look. "You missed half of the debate," she 
                    said sternly.</p>
